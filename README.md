This repository contains my projects completed for the Data Analysis with Python certification on freeCodeCamp.

Projects:

Data Analysis with Pandas: This project explores the basics of data manipulation and analysis using Pandas library. It covers loading datasets, cleaning data, and performing various data analysis tasks. (See data_analysis_pandas folder)
Time Series Analysis: This project delves into analyzing time-based data using Pandas. It covers working with time series data, extracting features, and visualizing trends. (See time_series_analysis folder)
Machine Learning Crash Course: This project provides an introduction to machine learning concepts like supervised learning and regression. It involves implementing a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn library. (See machine_learning_crash_course folder)
Weather Data Analysis: This project analyzes weather data to understand various weather patterns and relationships between different weather variables. (See weather_data_analysis folder)
Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup: This project demonstrates how to scrape data from websites using Beautiful Soup library. It includes extracting specific data points and building a basic dataset. (See web_scraping_beautiful_soup folder)
Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy (may be used in some projects)
Matplotlib (may be used in some projects)
Seaborn (may be used in some projects)
scikit-learn (used in Machine Learning Crash Course)
